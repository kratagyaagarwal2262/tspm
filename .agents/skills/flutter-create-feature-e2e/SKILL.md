description: Build or upgrade a complete feature (model, repo, bloc, view, widgets, tests) from a model spec, one API endpoint, acceptance criteria and a Figma node.
---

# End-to-end feature

Build a complete feature from **four user-provided inputs**:

1. **Model** – the data shape (Dart-like spec, JSON sample, or field list)
2. **API endpoint** – HTTP method + path + request/response association
3. **Acceptance criteria** – the AC list
4. **Figma design** – a node URL read via the Figma MCP server (`get_design_context`, `get_screenshot`, `get_metadata`, `get_variable_defs`); pasted CSS + screenshot accepted as a fallback

> This skill **does not** use Swagger or OpenAPI. Everything comes from the four inputs above.

## Architecture

Before creating UI, constants, dialogs, or shared helpers, invoke `$flutter-core-architecture`. Reuse what it lists; do not invent parallel dialogs, text widgets, or theme constants.

## Two Modes

| Mode | When | What happens |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Build** (default) | Feature folder doesn't exist | Run Phases 0–10 below |
| **Upgrade** | `lib/features/{feature_name}/README.md` exists and mentions "fixture mode" | Skip to Phase U – see end of this file |

Detect the mode by checking for `lib/features/{feature_name}/README.md` containing the string "fixture mode" before starting.

## How This Works

Work through phases **in strict order**. Do not start Phase N+1 until Phase N is complete and presented to the user.

## Phase 0 – Validate Inputs

Before doing anything else, confirm you have **all four** inputs. If anything is missing, ask for it.

```
Checklist:
- [ ] Model spec (fields + types)
- [ ] API endpoint (method + path + request body / response shape link)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria (numbered list)
- [ ] Figma node URL (or CSS + screenshot fallback)

Derived:
- [ ] Feature name (snake_case)
- [ ] Feature PascalCase
```

If any are missing, **stop and ask** – do not invent the missing pieces.

Then judge whether the acceptance criteria are actually settled. They are not when any AC names
only the happy path, when loading / empty / failure behaviour is unstated, or when the input
arrived as client prose rather than a numbered list. In that case invoke `$grill` and use the AC list it produces as this phase's input. Scaffolding against thin
AC is how a feature reaches Phase 9 and then needs rebuilding.

## Phase 0.5 – Core architecture reuse

Report the reuse decision from the `flutter-core-architecture` read above: which existing components, utils and tokens this feature uses, and every `App*` constant you must add because no existing token fits.

## Phase 1 – Parse & Plan (no code yet)

Produce **four tables** and present them to the user before writing any code.

### 1a. Feature Design Table (from Acceptance Criteria)

| # | Acceptance criterion | Event | State status | Repo method | Edge case |
|---|----------------------|-------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | User can view items | `ItemsRequested` | `loading` → `success` | `fetchItems` | Empty list → success with empty data |
| 2 | Errors are shown | – | `failure` | – | Show snackbar, retry button |

### 1b. API Contract Table (from API Endpoint)

| # | Method | Path | Request schema | Response schema | Success codes |
|---|--------|------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | GET | `/items` | – | `ItemsResponse` | 200 |
| 2 | POST | `/items` | `CreateItemRequest` | `ItemResponse` | 201 |

### 1c. Schema Field Map (from Model)

For every model class, list:

| Class | Field | Source type | Nullable? | Dart type | fromJson default |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| `Item` | `id` | string | no | `String` | `?? ''` |
| `Item` | `price` | number | no | `double` | `?? 0.0` |
| `Item` | `tags` | array<string> | no | `List<String>` | `?? []` |

### 1d. Design Token Map (from `get_design_context` + `get_variable_defs`)

Run `get_variable_defs` first; map named variables to constants, then fill remaining raw values from `get_design_context` (it returns CSS-like values). Every value becomes a row.

| CSS property | Value | Flutter equivalent | Constant target |
|--------------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|
| `background` | `#FFFFFF` | `Color(0xFFFFFFFF)` | `AppColors.background` |
| `padding` | `16px 24px` | `EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 24.w, vertical: 16.h)` | – |
| `border-radius` | `12px` | `BorderRadius.circular(12.r)` | – |
| `font-size` | `16px` | `16.sp` | `AppTextStyles.bodyMedium` |
| `font-weight` | `500` | `FontWeight.w500` | – |
| `gap` | `8px` | `SizedBox(height: 8.h)` between Column children | – |
| `color` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` | `Color(0x80000000)` | `AppColors.textMuted` |
| `box-shadow` | `0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` | `BoxShadow(offset: Offset(0, 2.h), blurRadius: 4.r, color: Color(0x1A000000))` | – |
| `display: flex; flex-direction: row` | – | `Row(...)` | – |
| `justify-content` | `space-between` | `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` | – |
| `align-items` | `center` | `CrossAxisAlignment.center` | – |
| `width: 100%` | – | `double.infinity` or `Expanded` | – |

### 1e. Layout Plan (from `get_metadata` + `get_screenshot`)

Sketch the widget tree before writing it:

```
Scaffold
└── SafeArea
    └── Padding
        └── Column
            ├── _Header
            ├── _SearchBar
            ├── Expanded
            │   └── ListView.separated
            │       └── _ItemCard
            └── _PrimaryButton
```

Identify which sub-trees become reusable widgets in `widget/`.

**Stop here and present all five sub-sections to the user.** Wait for confirmation before Phase 2.

## Phase 2 – Constants & Assets

Update / create:

- `lib/core/constants/app_colors.dart` – add every new color from Phase 1d
- `lib/core/constants/app_text_styles.dart` – add every typography variant
- `lib/core/constants/app_strings.dart` – add every static label
- `lib/core/constants/app_assets.dart` – add every image / icon
- `pubspec.yaml` – register new asset paths
- `lib/core/router/exports.dart` – append `export` lines for any **new** constant / asset / component / util / model / repo / bloc / view / widget file you create in later phases

No inline values in feature code – everything refers to a constant.

## Phase 3 – Models

Create in `lib/features/{feature_name}/model/`:

- **One file per logical group** (e.g. `{feature}_request.dart`, `{feature}_response.dart`)
- Use Phase 1c (Schema Field Map) as the source of truth
- Follow the `flutter-create-model` skill for templates
- Every class: `@immutable`, `final` fields, `fromJson` + `toJson`, `props`

## Phase 4 – Repository

Create `lib/features/{feature_name}/repo/{feature_name}_repository.dart`:

- One method per row in Phase 1b (API Contract Table)
- Constructor-inject `ApiClient` (null fallback)
- GET → `Future<T?>`
- POST / PUT / PATCH → `Future<Either<Failure, T>>`
- DELETE → `Future<Either<Failure, void>>`
- All `try/catch` + `debugPrint` with method context
- Follow the `flutter-create-repository` skill for templates

## Phase 5 – BLoC

Create the triad in `lib/features/{feature_name}/bloc/`:

- Events from Phase 1a column "Event"
- Status enum values from Phase 1a column "State status"
- One handler per event
- Constructor-inject repository
- Follow the `flutter-create-state-layer` skill for templates

## Phase 6 – View & Widgets

Create:

- `lib/features/{feature_name}/view/{feature_name}_page.dart` – `BlocProvider` root
- `lib/features/{feature_name}/widget/*.dart` – every reusable chunk from Phase 1e

Wire pattern:

- `BlocProvider` fires the initial event from Phase 1a
- `BlocListener` handles side-effects (snackbars, navigation)
- `BlocBuilder` / `BlocConsumer` renders state
- Use `switch (state.status)` for state-driven UI
- All dimensions from `AppDimensions`, in the project's sizing strategy; font sizes unscaled
- Translate Phase 1d (Design Token Map) row by row into the build method

**Verify against the `get_screenshot` render** (or the fallback screenshot) after writing. If anything differs, adjust before moving on.

## Phase 7 – Route Registration

- Add `static const String routeName = '/{feature}';` to the page class
- Register the route in `lib/core/router/`
- If the route takes arguments, pass them as a typed `{Feature}Arguments` class – never raw `Map`

## Phase 8 – Tests

Create `test/features/{feature_name}/`:

- `bloc/{feature_name}_bloc_test.dart` – at least 3 cases per handler (happy / null / exception)
- `repo/{feature_name}_repository_test.dart` – mock `ApiClient`, test success + error responses
- `widget/{feature_name}_page_test.dart` – render under each status

Map every acceptance criterion in the `AC coverage` group. Follow the `flutter-write-tests` skill for templates.

Run:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter test
```

## Phase 9 – Acceptance Criteria Coverage Check

Walk the AC list end-to-end:

| AC # | Implemented in | Test |
|------|----------------|------|
| 1 | `bloc._onItemsRequested` + `_ItemsView` | `'emits [loading, success]...'` |
| 2 | `BlocListener` snackbar branch | `'emits [loading, failure] when repository throws'` |

If any row is empty, finish it before declaring done.

## Phase 10 – Final Verification

invoke `$flutter-verify` and climb its ladder as far as the acceptance criteria
require. It owns the commands, the known-failure baseline, and the rule for which rung a given
claim needs — do not re-derive them here, and do not report the suite as green without checking
its baseline table first.

Report the rung you stopped on, and name any AC you could **not** prove at that rung.

Then confirm:

- Every new `.dart` file imports **only** `../../../core/router/exports.dart`.
- Every new file is exported from `lib/core/router/exports.dart`.
- Snackbars / dialogs / navigation use the shared helpers (`showSuccessSnackBar`, `showErrorSnackBar`, `ConfirmationDialogMixin` / `showIosAlertDialog`, `NavigationService.instance`) — see `flutter-core-architecture`.
- No restate-the-signature doc comments left behind.

## Hard rules

Barrel imports, the constants families, the shared component set and the cross-feature boundary
belong to `flutter-core-architecture`, called in the Architecture section above. What binds this
skill specifically:

- Build from the four inputs only. This skill reads no Swagger or OpenAPI document.
- Finish every requirement in the phase that owns it. A `TODO` left behind means the phase is
  incomplete, and Phase 9 will report a criterion as covered when it is not.
- Keep `// FIXTURE_START`, `// FIXTURE_END` and `/// FIXTURE:` markers exactly as they are.
- Comments explain *why*. The signature already says what.
- Stop after Phase 1 and present the planning tables. The tables are what every later phase reads.
- After Phase 6, compare the built screen against the `get_screenshot` render, or the fallback
  screenshot, and say what differs.

## Sub-agent delegation, optional

When the feature is large, delegate independent phases to sub-agents in parallel. Do this only once
the Phase 1 tables are stable: a sub-agent given a table that is still moving builds against a shape
that will change under it.

When this project has `docs/agents/agent-routing.md`, select the matching custom agent there for
each delegated phase. Pass the table that owns the phase, its matching skill invocation, acceptance
criteria, and exclusive file ownership. Start the delegated phase without an extra user prompt.
If no project routing file exists, use the matching skill with a general sub-agent.

| Phase | The sub-agent's skill | What to hand it |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 3 – Models | `$flutter-create-model` | The Schema Field Map (1c) |
| 4 – Repository | `$flutter-create-repository` | The API Contract Table (1b) |
| 6 – Widgets | `$flutter-create-screen` | The Design Token Map (1d) and Layout Plan (1e) |
| 8 – Tests | `$flutter-write-tests` | The Feature Design Table (1a) and the acceptance criteria |

---

## Phase U – Upgrade Mode

Use this phase **instead of** Phases 0–10 when the feature was previously scaffolded by `flutter-create-screen-e2e` (the `lib/features/{feature_name}/README.md` mentions "fixture mode").

The goal is to replace fixtures with the real API + model **without changing**:

- BLoC events, states, or handler signatures
- Screen layout, widgets, or styling
- Acceptance-criteria coverage in tests

### U.0 – Validate Inputs

Confirm the user has now supplied:

- [ ] Model spec
- [ ] API endpoint (method + path + request/response shape)

If either is missing, stop and ask.

### U.1 – Diff Inferred Schema vs Real Model

Open `lib/features/{feature_name}/model/{feature_name}_response.dart` and read every class marked with `/// FIXTURE:`. Compare against the real model spec and produce:

| Class | Field | Inferred | Real | Action |
|-------|-------|----------|------|--------|
| `Product` | `price` | `double` | `int` (cents) | Change type + update consumers |
| `Product` | `imageUrl` | `String` | `String` (from `image_url`) | Keep |
| `Product` | – | – | `currency: String` | **Add** field |
| `Product` | `isFavorite` | `bool` | – | **Remove** field – check screen for usages |

Present the table to the user. Stop for confirmation before editing.

### U.2 – Update Models

- Remove every `/// FIXTURE:` docstring
- Apply the diff from U.1
- Add request DTOs for write endpoints
- Rerun `dart format` on edited files

### U.3 – Replace Fixture Repository

For every method in `repo/{feature_name}_repository.dart`:

1. Keep the method signature **exactly as-is** (parent BLoC depends on it)
2. Replace the body between `// FIXTURE_START` and `// FIXTURE_END` with a real `_apiClient` call
3. Remove the `// FIXTURE_START` / `// FIXTURE_END` markers after the body is real
4. Add the `ApiClient` constructor injection (null fallback):

```dart
class {Feature}Repository {
  final ApiClient _apiClient;
  {Feature}Repository({ApiClient? apiClient}) : _apiClient = apiClient ?? ApiClient();
  ...
}
```

5. Remove the class-level `/// FIXTURE:` docstring once **every** method body is real

If any consumer relied on a synchronous fixture quirk (e.g. instant data), surface it as a state-change side-effect in the bloc, not in the repo.

### U.4 – Adapt BLoC if Schema Changed

If U.1 added or removed fields, walk every handler that reads / writes those fields. The BLoC structure itself does not change – only the field accesses.

### U.5 – Adapt Screen if Schema Changed

If a removed field had UI presence (e.g. `isFavorite`'s heart icon), choose with the user:

- Remove the UI element, **or**
- Keep it driven by local state instead of the model

If an added field has no UI yet, that's fine – leave it in the model for future screens.

### U.6 – Retire Handoff README

Update `lib/features/{feature_name}/README.md`:

- Remove the "fixture mode" header
- Add a one-line note: "Upgraded to real API on {date}. Endpoint: {method} {path}."

### U.7 – Re-run Tests

- Update test mocks to mock `ApiClient` instead of returning hardcoded lists
- Update test fixtures to match the real model shape (if changed)
- Remove the `// FIXTURE:` test-file header
- `flutter test` must pass

### U.8 – Verification

```bash
flutter analyze
dart format .
flutter test
rg --no-heading 'FIXTURE' lib/features/{feature_name}/ test/features/{feature_name}/ || echo 'All fixture markers removed.'
```

The `rg` command must return "All fixture markers removed." – any remaining `FIXTURE` markers in the feature folder are a regression.

### U.9 – AC Coverage Re-Check

Walk the AC list again. Confirm every criterion still has a test row. Add new tests for any behaviour the real API exposes (e.g. specific error codes).
