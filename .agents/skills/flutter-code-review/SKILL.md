description: Review changes on two independent axes: does the code follow the project's conventions, and does it do what the spec asked. Use when the user wants a branch, PR, or work-in-progress reviewed, or asks to review since a commit or branch.

# Flutter code review

Two axes over the same diff, run as **parallel sub-agents** so neither contaminates the other, then
reported side by side:

- **Conventions** — does the code follow this project's documented rules?
- **Spec** — does the code do what the acceptance criteria asked for?

A change can pass one and fail the other. Code that follows every convention and builds the wrong
thing is a **conventions pass, spec fail**, and it is the failure mode that costs a client project a
whole round. Reporting the axes separately is what stops one masking the other.

## 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user names: a commit, a branch, a tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`. Ask if they did not say.

```bash
git rev-parse <fixed-point>            # confirm it resolves
git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD          # three-dot: against the merge base
git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline
```

Confirm the ref resolves and the diff is non-empty **before** spawning anything. A bad ref should
fail here, not inside two sub-agents.

## 2. Find the spec

In order: a spec file under the directory `docs/agents/project.md` names, matching the branch or
feature; an issue referenced in the commit messages; a path the user passed. If nothing turns up,
ask. If the user says there is no spec, run the conventions axis alone and report the spec axis as
"no spec available" — never silently drop it, because a change with no written criteria is itself
worth surfacing on client work.

## 3. Gather the convention sources

Read what the project documents: `AGENTS.md`, anything under `rules/`, `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary.
Those always win.

On top of whatever the project documents, the conventions axis always carries the **Flutter
baseline** below. Two rules bind it: a documented project rule **overrides** the baseline wherever
they disagree, and every baseline item is a **judgement call**, flagged as "possible", never as a
violation. Skip anything `flutter analyze` already enforces — a linter finding is not a review
finding.

### The Flutter baseline

Each reads *what it is* → *why it matters here*.

- **Widget-helper methods.** A private method returning a `Widget` instead of a `StatelessWidget`
  class. → Breaks `const` construction and rebuild scoping; the whole parent rebuilds.
- **Business logic in the widget tree.** Computation, formatting, or branching inside `build` that
  belongs in the bloc or a model. → Untestable without pumping a widget.
- **`BuildContext`, navigation, or snackbars in a bloc.** → Couples state to presentation and breaks
  bloc tests.
- **Inline literals.** A hex colour, a user-facing string, an asset path, or a magic number written
  at the point of use. → The reason a rebrand or a copy change becomes a hunt.
- **A sizing strategy other than the one `docs/agents/project.md` names.** → Two competing scale
  systems in one tree.
- **A font size scaled at the callsite.** → Overrides the OS text-scale setting a user chose for
  legibility, so the app ignores an accessibility preference.
- **`dynamic`, or an unchecked cast off JSON.** → Moves a parse failure from the boundary to a
  random later frame.
- **A repository that swallows an error into a bare `null`** where the project's convention returns
  a typed failure. → The UI cannot tell "empty" from "broken".
- **Missing state coverage.** A status enum whose `loading`, `failure`, or empty case has no branch
  in the UI. → The single most common source of a feedback round.
- **`setState` inside a bloc-managed screen.** → Two sources of truth for one screen.
- **An unbounded `ListView` or a rebuild over an unkeyed list.** → Jank and lost scroll position.
- **A `dispose` that does not cancel** a subscription, controller, or timer it created. → Leaks.
- **A new file outside the project's import convention**, or one not exported where the project's
  barrel requires it. → Compiles locally, breaks the next importer.
- **A fixture or placeholder marker left in code the change presents as finished**, where the
  project treats those markers as a temporary state. → Ships a stub as a feature.

## 4. Spawn both axes in parallel

**Conventions sub-agent.** Give it the diff command, the commit list, the project's documented rule
files, and **the baseline above pasted in full** — it has no other access to it. Brief: report, per
file or hunk, every place the diff breaks a documented rule, citing the rule and where it is written;
then every baseline item you spot, named and quoted. Distinguish documented-rule breaches from
baseline judgement calls, and note that a documented rule overrides the baseline. Skip anything the
analyzer catches. Under 400 words.

**Spec sub-agent.** Give it the diff command, the commit list, and the spec's contents. Brief:
report (a) criteria that are missing or only partly built; (b) behaviour in the diff nobody asked
for; (c) criteria that look implemented but look wrong. Quote the criterion for every finding. Pay
particular attention to criteria naming loading, empty, or failure states, since those are the ones
most often dropped. Under 400 words.

## 5. Aggregate

Present both under `## Conventions` and `## Spec`, verbatim or lightly cleaned. **Do not merge or
rerank across axes** — that is exactly the collapse the separation prevents.

Close with one line per axis: how many findings, and the worst one within that axis. No single
overall verdict, and no "looks good overall" that averages a spec failure away.

If the spec axis found anything under (b), scope creep, say so plainly and separately. On fixed-scope
work, unrequested behaviour is a cost even when the code is good.
